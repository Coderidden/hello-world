First Repository

Hello Github, my name is Christopher Baus and looking to see what GitHub is all about as well as improve my coding skills along the way!! I have some knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Java, and Oracle PL/SQL.

Hope that we can help each other through our coding escapades!
